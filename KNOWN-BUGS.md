## Designer

Designer Drag&Drop feature works fine with Chrome Browser but is
broken (at various levels) with other browsers.

## npm libraries issues

Once Ares is  updated with `git` and `git submodule  update`, the node
library must be updated with `npm prune` and then `npm install`.

After several updates,  you may encounter errors with  the server like
start failure  or `project.json`  corruption. In  this case,  `npm ls`
will  return  errors   showing  problems  with  the   content  of  the
`node_modules` directory.

These errors  can be often be  fixed by running `npm  prune`.  If not,
you have to:

* remove the whole `node_modules` directory
* run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* run `npm -d install`.

## PhoneGap Build

[ENYO-3491 Generated QRcode to download app contains user's authentication token](https://enyojs.atlassian.net/browse/ENYO-3491)

Symptom: Ares Build status show a QRcode containing an URL that can be
used to download an application directly on a mobile device.
Currently, this URL contains the token of the developer's
account. This raises a security issue as the user can then get access
to the developer's account on phonegap until the token is revoked.

Workaround: Use the QRcode generated by Ares only for your tests. Send
the QRcode generated by Phonegap to your users.
